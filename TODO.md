Pretty much everything.

* Automatically install xsession file, add to alternatives, and install icon
* Make an icon
* Resize windows with mouse
* Handle alt+click to drag
* Take a config file for stuff
* Wallpaper
* Spawn things on keybinds
* Run menu (maybe just dmenu on keybind)
* Stacking
* Some sorta right-click run menu, as in CWM?
* Window decorations?
* Tiling?:
  * Could be based on keybinds, not true tiling, just snapping
  * If true tiling, resize with keybinds, swapping panes
  * Saved layouts? (Probably not)
* Use super key for everything (snapping, triggering)
* dmenu_run and x-terminal-emulator bound by default
* emphasize that wmjs is Configuration over Convention(TM), because if you
  wanted the same window manager as everyone else you'd be using windows.

SUPER is 65, space is 133, or maybe that's the other way around
