Pretty much everything.

* Automatically install xsession file, add to alternatives, and install icon
* Make an icon
* Resize windows with mouse
* Handle alt+click to drag
* Take a config file for stuff
* Wallpaper
* Spawn things on keybinds
* Run menu (maybe just dmenu on keybind)
* Stacking
* Some sorta right-click run menu, as in CWM?
* Window decorations?
* Tiling?:
  * Could be based on keybinds, not true tiling, just snapping
  * If true tiling, resize with keybinds, swapping panes
  * Saved layouts? (Probably not)
* Use super key for everything (snapping, triggering)
* dmenu_run and x-terminal-emulator bound by default
