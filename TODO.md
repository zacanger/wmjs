Pretty much everything.

* Automatically install xsession file, add to alternatives, and install icon
* Make an icon
* Handle alt+click to drag
* Take a config file for stuff
* Wallpaper
* Spawn things on keybinds
* Run menu (maybe just dmenu on keybind)
* Stacking
* 'Tiling' based on screen size and keybinds
* Some sorta right-click run menu, as in CWM?
* Window decorations?
